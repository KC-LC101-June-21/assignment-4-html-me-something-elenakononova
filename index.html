                        Lake with stunning alpine scenery situated amongst world-renowned ski resorts,
                         this ruggedly beautiful region delivers endless opportunities for fun.
                        Whether you’re seeking a family-friendly weekend or an adventure-filled excursion,
                         the central region of Summit County (encompassing Dillon, Frisco and Silverthorne)
                          serves as the perfect basecamp for your high-country vacation.
                           You’ll be dazzled by statuesque mountains topping out above 14,000 feet,
                            the pristine Dillon Reservoir (also known as Lake Dillon), bold rivers with renowned rapids and fishing holes,
                             along with hundreds of miles of wilderness.</p>

                 </header>
                     <p>What do you get when you combine the waters of a famous Colorado fishing river with a tailwater and 3.8 miles of water above another reservoir?
                     You get a great place for fish to live and breed. This river also turns out to be a Gold Medal water with the nickname of the "Dream Stream".
                     Where are we describing? It's the section of the South Platte River between Spinney and Elevenmile Reservoirs in South Park, also known as Spinney Mountain State Wildlife Area. In 2010, the State Wildlife Area (SWA) was renamed Charlie Meyers SWA, in honor of the well-known deceased Denver Post Outdoor writer.
                     This portion of the South Platte starts below Spinney Reservoir and meanders through grasslands for about 3.8 miles before entering Elevenmile Reservoir.
                     The bad news - it can be crowded, cold and windy. The good news - there are some large trout in this 'dream stream' and hence the Gold Medal label. Here you can try your best to catch a large Rainbow or Brown, and even Kokanee in the fall.
What makes this section of the South Platte so appealing is that you have the tailwaters from Spinney keeping the water at a reasonably constant temperature offering year-round fishing. The entire stretch is public water.
 Fish come upstream from Elevenmile Reservoir to spawn. The riverbanks are grassy with no trees to eat your fly. What else do you want - no wind and warm weather? Well, once in awhile.</p>
